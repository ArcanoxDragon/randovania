    # Guidelines for joke hints:
    # 1. They should clearly be jokes, and not real hints or the result of a bug.
    # 2. They shouldn't reference real-world people.
    # 3. They should be understandable by as many people as possible.
    # These hints are used if a game does not have joke hints defined.
